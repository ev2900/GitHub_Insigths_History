# GitHub Insigths History
 
GitHub provides insights for repositories including page views and unique visitor counts. GitHub only provides 2 weeks of history for these metrics. 

The script(s) in this repository collect and store these metrics (page views and unique visitor counts) for all of a given GitHub user's repositories. Storing these metrics outside of GitHub allows a user to retain a longer history for page views and unique visitor counts metrics.

To view the historic data of views for my repositories check out [views.csv](https://github.com/ev2900/GitHub_Insigths_History/blob/main/Metric_Collection/Metric_Data/views.csv) for unique visits check out [unique_visits.csv](https://github.com/ev2900/GitHub_Insigths_History/blob/main/Metric_Collection/Metric_Data/unique_visits.csv)
