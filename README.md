# GitHub Insigths History
 
GitHub provides insights for repositories including page views and unique visitor counts. GitHub only provides 2 weeks of history for these metrics. 

The script(s) in this repository collect and store these metrics (page views and unique visitor counts) for all of a given GitHub user's repositories. Storing these metrics outside of GitHub allows a user to retain a longer histroy for page views and unique visitor counts metrics.
